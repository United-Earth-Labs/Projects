# Cyborg Technology

Cyborg Technology focuses on **human–machine integration**—technology designed to enhance human capabilities without replacing or dehumanizing the human being.

This is not about turning people into machines. It is about extending human limits responsibly.

## What Is Cyborg Technology?

This domain explores:
- Neural interfaces
- Sensory augmentation
- Assistive and enhancement devices
- Bio-compatible machine integration

The emphasis is on **seamless interaction**, not invasive control.

## Why This Matters for Humanity

Human biology has limits:
- Reaction speed
- Sensory range
- Physical endurance
- Cognitive bandwidth

Technology already extends these externally. Cyborg systems aim to do so **directly, safely, and ethically**, enabling humans to adapt to increasingly complex environments.

## Current Status

This project is in the **research phase**.

Focus areas include:
- Interface concepts
- Ethical constraints
- Biological compatibility
- Long-term societal impact

No experimental human trials are conducted here.
