## What Is Solar Energy Harvesting?

This project investigates:
- High-efficiency solar capture systems
- Large-area and orbital concepts
- Energy storage and transmission
- Grid-scale solar integration

The focus is not consumer panels, but **civilization-level energy supply**.

---

## Why This Matters for Humanity

Energy scarcity limits:
- Economic growth
- Technological progress
- Environmental stability

A Type 1 Civilization must rely on **renewable, planet-scale energy sources**. Solar energy is the most abundant and reliable option available.

---

## Current Status

This initiative is in the **research and modeling phase**.

Work includes:
- Energy yield calculations
- System feasibility studies
- Loss and efficiency modeling
- Long-term sustainability analysis
