# Contributing Guidelines

This document defines how contributions are made, evaluated, and integrated into projects within this organization.

If you are looking for quick wins, tutorials, or passive participation, this is not the right place.

---

## Who Should Contribute

We welcome contributors who:
- Think independently and critically
- Are comfortable working with incomplete or evolving designs
- Prefer building and testing over theorizing endlessly
- Can document their reasoning and decisions clearly

You do not need to be an expert, but you must be serious.

---

## Types of Contributions

Valid contributions include:
- Design proposals with clear reasoning
- Prototypes (physical, mechanical, or simulated)
- Calculations, models, or feasibility analyses
- Documentation improvements
- Test results and failure reports

Ideas without follow-through are not contributions.

---

## How to Contribute

1. Review existing documentation to understand scope and constraints
2. Open an issue describing:
   - What you want to work on
   - Why it matters
   - What assumptions you are making
3. Keep changes focused and justified
4. Document failures as carefully as successes
5. Submit a pull request with clear explanations

---

## Standards & Expectations

- Claims must be supported by evidence or clearly labeled as speculative
- Safety considerations must be explicitly addressed
- Code, designs, and documents should be understandable by others
- Ambiguity should be reduced, not hidden

---

## Communication Style

- Be direct and technical
- Challenge ideas, not people
- Disagreement is expected; disrespect is not tolerated
- Decisions should be justified with reasoning or data

---

## Intellectual Property

By contributing, you agree that:
- Your contributions may be used in research, prototypes, or patent filings
- Proper credit will be given where appropriate
- No confidential or proprietary material should be submitted

If you are unsure about IP implications, clarify before contributing.

## Final Note
This organization values **progress over polish** and **evidence over enthusiasm**.

Contribute only if you are willing to engage at that level.
