# Planetary Mining

Planetary Mining investigates large-scale resource extraction beyond Earth, including asteroids, moons, and planetary bodies.

---

## What Is Planetary Mining?

This project explores:
- Asteroid resource extraction
- Off-world material processing
- Autonomous mining systems
- Logistics of space-based resources

The focus is long-term feasibility, not near-term commercialization.

---

## Why This Matters for Humanity

Earth has finite resources. Expansion beyond Earth requires:
- External material sources
- Reduced planetary environmental damage
- Sustainable industrial growth

Planetary mining enables civilization growth without exhausting a single world.

## Current Status

This project remains in the **research and planning phase**.

Work includes:
- Orbital mechanics
- Resource modeling
- System design concepts
- Economic feasibility studies
