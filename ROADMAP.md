# Project Roadmap

This roadmap applies to all active projects within the organization unless stated otherwise.

Timelines are intentionally flexible. Progress is measured by validated learning, not deadlines.

---

## Phase 1: Concept Definition
**Status:** In progress / completed per project

Goals:
- Clearly define the problem being addressed
- Identify existing solutions and gaps
- Establish constraints (technical, ergonomic, safety)
- Document assumptions explicitly

Deliverables:
- Problem statement
- Initial system concept
- Constraint list

---

## Phase 2: Feasibility Research
**Status:** Ongoing

Goals:
- Validate whether the concept is physically and technically feasible
- Identify limiting factors early
- Reduce unknowns through modeling and analysis

Deliverables:
- Feasibility notes
- Basic simulations or calculations
- Risk and failure mode identification

---

## Phase 3: Early Prototyping
**Status:** Planned / ongoing per project

Goals:
- Build simple, testable prototypes
- Validate core mechanisms, not polish
- Learn through failure and iteration

Deliverables:
- Physical or functional prototypes
- Test results and observations
- Iteration notes

---

## Phase 4: Refinement & Testing
**Status:** Planned

Goals:
- Improve reliability and usability
- Perform controlled testing
- Validate safety limits and performance bounds

Deliverables:
- Refined prototype
- Test reports
- Performance benchmarks

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & IP
**Status:** Planned

Goals:
- Formalize designs and findings
- Prepare documentation suitable for patents or publications
- Decide continuation path (research, product, or archival)

Deliverables:
- Technical documentation
- Patent drafts or disclosures
- Research summaries

---

## Out of Scope
- Marketing or hype-driven development
- Weaponization-focused designs
- Claims without empirical support

---

## Guiding Principle
Progress is defined by **what we can demonstrate**, not what we can imagine.
