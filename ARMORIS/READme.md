# ARMORIS

### Flexible Arm-Mounted Personal Computing Interface

## Overview

**ARMORIS** is a research and prototyping project exploring a new form factor for personal computing devices. Instead of rigid, block-shaped hardware, ARMORIS investigates a flexible, arm-mounted system that wraps around the user’s forearm and deploys into an active interface when authenticated.

The project aims to rethink how humans physically carry, access, and interact with everyday computing devices by prioritizing ergonomics, portability, and security.

## Problem Statement

Modern personal devices are constrained by rigid enclosures, fixed geometries, and inefficient ergonomics. These limitations result in:

* Poor portability
* Awkward one-handed interaction
* Limited adaptability to the human body

Current wearable devices often sacrifice capability for compactness or comfort for rigidity.

## Proposed Solution

ARMORIS proposes a flexible device architecture that:

* Wraps around the forearm in a band-like configuration
* Deploys or activates only after biometric authentication
* Reduces dependence on bulky rigid frames
* Integrates naturally with the human body

The goal is not miniaturization alone, but **form-factor evolution**.

## Key Objectives

* Explore flexible electronics and materials
* Design ergonomic arm-mounted interfaces
* Integrate biometric-based activation for security
* Study power, durability, and usability trade-offs
* Build a functional prototype demonstrating feasibility

## Current Status

**Prototype Stage**

Early concepts and form-factor experiments are under development.

## Planned Next Steps

* Functional prototype refinement
* Material stress and durability testing
* Power management optimization
* User interaction testing
* Patent filing and IP documentation

## Scope & Constraints

* This project focuses on **form factor and interaction**, not full device replacement
* All designs prioritize safety, comfort, and practicality
* Claims are validated through prototyping and testing, not speculation

This is how projects graduate from ideas to engineering.
