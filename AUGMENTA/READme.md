# AUGMENTA

### Wearable Hand-Mounted Force Augmentation System

## Overview

**AUGMENTA** is a research-focused project investigating wearable systems for **human strength augmentation**. The project centers on a hand and forearm-mounted device designed to assist and amplify applied force while maintaining user control, safety, and ergonomic integrity.

AUGMENTA focuses on **augmentation**, not automation or replacement.

## Problem Statement

Human physical strength is biologically limited, which restricts performance in tasks involving:

* Repetitive high-force exertion
* Precision under load
* Extended physical endurance

Existing strength-assist systems are often bulky, expensive, or impractical for individual use.

## Proposed Solution

AUGMENTA explores a wearable gauntlet architecture that:

* Assists hand and forearm movement
* Amplifies applied force using mechanical or electromechanical systems
* Preserves natural motion and user intent
* Enforces strict safety and load limits

Force amplification targets are treated as **research goals**, not fixed guarantees.

## Key Objectives

* Study safe human strength augmentation
* Design efficient force-transmission mechanisms
* Maintain ergonomic, intuitive control
* Explore industrial, assistive, and rehabilitation applications
* Validate designs through modeling and controlled testing

## Current Status

**Research Phase**

Conceptual designs and feasibility studies are ongoing.

## Planned Next Steps

* Biomechanical and safety analysis
* Load modeling and failure analysis
* Early mechanical prototypes
* Controlled testing and iteration
* Patent strategy and documentation

## Safety & Ethics

* Human safety is a non-negotiable constraint
* Designs are bounded by biomechanical limits
* Weaponization is explicitly **out of scope**

## Scope & Constraints

* This project does not aim to bypass human control
* All augmentation is assistive and bounded
* Claims are validated through experimentation, not assumption
