# Risks & Limitations

This document outlines known and anticipated risks associated with the projects in this organization.  
Risks are treated as design inputs, not afterthoughts.

---

## Technical Risks

### 1. Feasibility Limits
Some concepts may prove impractical due to constraints in materials, power density, actuation methods, or current manufacturing capabilities.

Mitigation:
- Early feasibility studies
- Conservative performance targets
- Iterative prototyping to expose limits quickly

---

### 2. Power & Efficiency Constraints
Wearable systems are severely constrained by available power, heat dissipation, and battery capacity.

Mitigation:
- Energy-efficient design prioritization
- Low-power prototyping before feature expansion
- Explicit trade-off documentation

---

### 3. Mechanical Failure
Moving parts, flexible materials, and wearable interfaces are subject to fatigue, wear, and unexpected failure modes.

Mitigation:
- Load modeling and stress analysis
- Redundant safety limits
- Controlled testing environments

---

## Human & Safety Risks

### 4. Injury Risk
Any system interacting with the human body—especially augmentation systems—poses potential injury risks if poorly designed or misused.

Mitigation:
- Conservative force and motion limits
- Fail-safe design principles
- Clear usage constraints
- Testing before human interaction

---

### 5. Ergonomic Misalignment
Poor ergonomic design can lead to discomfort, strain, or long-term harm.

Mitigation:
- Human-centered design practices
- Iterative comfort testing
- Adjustability and modularity

---

## Project & Execution Risks

### 6. Overclaiming
Exaggerated claims undermine credibility and attract the wrong contributors.

Mitigation:
- Evidence-first documentation
- Clear separation of goals vs. demonstrated results
- Explicit labeling of speculative ideas

---

### 7. Scope Creep
Uncontrolled feature expansion can stall progress and dilute focus.

Mitigation:
- Strict adherence to defined objectives
- Incremental development
- Periodic scope reviews

---

### 8. Contributor Misalignment
Contributors with incompatible expectations, motivations, or skill levels can slow progress.

Mitigation:
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Emphasis on self-directed work
- Documentation-driven collaboration

---

## Legal & Ethical Risks

### 9. Intellectual Property Conflicts
Improper handling of ideas and contributions may create IP disputes.

Mitigation:
- Clear contribution terms
- Transparent authorship and acknowledgment
- Early IP documentation

---

### 10. Ethical Misuse
Technologies intended for augmentation or interaction may be misapplied.

Mitigation:
- Explicit project boundaries
- Ethical review during design decisions
- Exclusion of weaponization-focused work

## Closing Note
Not all risks can be eliminated. The goal is to **identify, manage, and learn from them early**, rather than discovering them after investment or deployment.
