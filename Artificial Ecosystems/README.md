# Artificial Ecosystems

Artificial Ecosystems focuses on designing **self-sustaining biological systems** that can operate independently of Earth’s natural biosphere.

## What Are Artificial Ecosystems?

This domain explores:
- Closed-loop life support systems
- Synthetic biomes
- Controlled ecological cycles
- Long-term habitat sustainability

These systems are essential for environments where Earth’s ecosystem cannot function.

## Why This Matters for Humanity

Human survival beyond Earth requires:
- Independent food systems
- Oxygen and waste recycling
- Stable biological environments

Artificial ecosystems also offer insights into repairing damaged environments on Earth.

---

## Current Status

This initiative is in the **conceptual and research phase**.

Activities include:
- Ecological modeling
- System balance studies
- Lessons from existing closed ecosystems

No live ecosystems are being deployed.
