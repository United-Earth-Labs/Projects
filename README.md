# United Earth Labs — Projects Index

This repository serves as the **central registry of all projects** developed, researched, or maintained under **United Earth Labs (UEL)**.

If a project exists under the UEL organization, it should be documented here.

## 🎯 Purpose

UEL operates across multiple domains: future technology research, large-scale systems engineering, and free technical education. As the organization grows, this repository exists to provide:

- A single source of truth for all active and archived projects
- Clear ownership and status tracking
- Easy navigation for contributors, researchers, and learners
- Transparency in direction and scope

This is an **index**, not an implementation repository.

## 📋 Project Listing Format

Each project listed in this repository should include:

- **Project Name**
- **Category**
- **Current Status** (Concept / Research / Active / Maintained / Archived)
- **Primary Repository Link**
- **Brief Description**
- **Maintainer or Team (if applicable)**

This keeps the ecosystem understandable as it scales.

## ➕ Adding a New Project

To register a new project under UEL:

1. Create or identify the project repository.
2. Add the project entry to this index following the standard format.
3. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear description
