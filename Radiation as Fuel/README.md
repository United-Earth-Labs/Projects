# Radiation as Fuel

Radiation as Fuel explores whether harmful or waste radiation can be converted into usable energy.

This is a high-risk, high-impact research domain.

## What Is Radiation as Fuel?

This project investigates:
- Radiation capture mechanisms
- Conversion of ionizing radiation into usable energy
- Nuclear waste reuse concepts
- Safety and containment challenges

The goal is **mitigation through utilization**, not reckless exposure.

## Why This Matters for Humanity

Radiation is typically treated as a problem to isolate and bury. If even a fraction of it can be safely converted into energy, it could:
- Reduce long-term nuclear waste risks
- Provide energy in extreme environments
- Improve space and planetary systems

---

## Current Status

This project is **purely theoretical and research-based**.

There are:
- No reactors
- No prototypes
- No field experiments

Only modeling, physics research, and feasibility analysis.
